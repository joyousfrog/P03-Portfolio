          <h2>Harmony: Ocean Conductor VR</h2>

          <p>
            Harmony is an immersive VR experience in which the player explores a serene underwater environment where they are given the magical ability to conduct music using schools of fish. The game was built using Unity 3D and the XR Interaction toolkit, alongside a team of 4 classmates.
          </p>

          <p>
            My role was lead programmer and game designer in this project. I took great care while developing this game to make sure the experience would be welcoming to players of all skill levels. I pushed for us to include elements such as tutorials and accessibility options instead of expanding the scope of the game. Knowing we would only have 2 months to develop the project, our team decided to aim for quality over quantity. We spent time working on granular details such as intricate decorations, optimized game feel and graphical optimization, rather than spreading ourselves too thin working on multiple levels and overly-complex mechanics.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe this strategy proved to be highly effective in the end, as we produced a game that even those entirely unfamiliar with VR could play comfortably.
          </p>

          <p>
            As both a developer and designer, I understand the importance of rapid prototyping, and spent a considerable amount of time integrating features that never saw the light of day. Despite this, the effort was never wasted. We took time to test all of these mechanics (internally and externally), and only picked those that felt the best built upon our intended user experience. 
          </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            Ultimately, I believe this approach led to us creating a truly impressive project despite the limitations of this being a class project with a constrained development time. Instead of making a proof of concept, we built a highly-manicured and refined vertical slice that can easily be built-upon and expanded, but still stands on its own as a powerful experience.
